Edit "wmc" and change the settings at the top if your Wesnoth server is not in /home/wesnothowner/WesnothStartup

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- UI::Dialog
- Term::ReadKey
- Term::ANSIScreen

You also need to have my Wesnoth Server Startup Scripts and Backup Scripts installed.

I suggest you add this directory to your PATH variable so you can run this script directly and can update it and use the new version easily.
